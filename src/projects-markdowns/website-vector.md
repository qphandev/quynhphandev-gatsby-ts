    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        A mock cafe website made with HTML and CSS. Logo was made by me.
        <br />
        Logo, design, and code by me. It was one of my first times working with HTML and CSS, and designing a website. I experimented on what kind of design I wanted to go for and decided that instead of a typical format, I'd like to make it like an actual menu.
        <br />
        This also challenged me into designing and drawing the logo using Inkscape.
