    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Objects made in Maya and rendered with Mental Ray (Pencil was rendered in Substance Painter). Textured with Substance Painter.
        <br />
        Post-apocalyptic themed.
        <br />
        3D modeling can be very tedious and frustrating. The results are satsifying to see though.
