## Notes:
1. For some weird reason, media don't work in .md files if it's outside of its directory. 
2. Sometimes I run into Segmentation Fault error (which isn't a very helpful error). The general solution to this is to delete the package lock file. Alright... this is a really weird thing. Sometimes the fix is to simply run gatsby develop AGAIN after the error.

## TODOs:
* Make this README an actual README instead of a todo list lol
